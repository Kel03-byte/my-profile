Homework Assignment 2

I was tasked to create a responsive portfolio website to showcase my learning for this unit

## User Story

```
AS AN employer
I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed portfolio of work samples
SO THAT I can review samples of their work and assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position
```

I made the decision to create two, a mock up of the website that was used as the example and one of my own. ( I have linked the mock up in my own)
